    Making traditional beef pho can be an all-day affair, with the broth
    bubbling away for 3–6 hours. This instant pot version takes an hour and a
    half (including pressure-release time), but it doesn’t sacrifice flavor
    thanks to toasted spices and browned onions and ginger that get simmered
    along with beef bones and brisket. Using a variety of bones as well as
    brisket is the secret to umami-rich broth. While you’re waiting for the
    broth to finish cooking, prep all your garnishes and noodles so everything
    will come together quickly at the end. Pour the hot broth over your
    assembled bowls and watch your beef slices cook on the spot.

    <li>
      lb. 2"–3" sections mixed soup beef bones (oxtail, marrow, knuckles, and/or

    <li>
      tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt; plus more (optional)
    </li>
    <li>oz. dried thin Banh Pho rice noodles</li>
    <li>
      oz. beef eye of round, sirloin steak, London broil, or tri-tip steak
      Rinsed thinly sliced onion, thinly sliced scallions, chopped cilantro,
      Thai basil leaves, mint leaves, mung bean sprouts, sliced Thai or serrano
      chiles, lime wedges, Sriracha, and/or hoisin sauce (for serving; optional)
      Freshly ground black pepper
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Set a 6-qt. Instant Pot to high sauté. Toast star anise, cinnamon stick,
      and cloves, stirring, until fragrant and crackling slightly, about 2
      minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. oil and work around to coat bottom of pot. Reduce
      heat to medium, add onions, cut sides down, and ginger, and cook,
      undisturbed, until deep brown in spots, 5–7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour in 1 cup water, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon,
      then add beef bones, brisket, fish sauce, sugar, 2½ tsp. Diamond Crystal
      or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and another 6 cups water (or just up to
      your max fill line). Lock lid and turn venting knob to sealing position.
      Cook on high pressure 1 hour (it will take about 20 minutes to come to
      pressure before the cook time begins). Naturally release pressure 30
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      While the broth is cooking, place noodles in a large bowl and pour in cold
      water to cover. Let soak 30 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse to remove
      excess starch.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freeze beef eye of round until firm, 20–30 minutes. Thinly slice against
      the grain, then chill in refrigerator until ready to serve.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once pressure on pot has released 30 minutes, place a kitchen towel
      loosely over vent to prevent splattering. Using a wooden spoon, gradually
      open venting knob. As soon as floating pin drops, carefully open lid.
      Using tongs, transfer bones to a large bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place brisket in another large bowl and pour cool water over to cool down
      and keep from drying out. Using a fine-mesh sieve, scoop out solids from
      broth; discard aromatics and reserve any meat and bones for serving if
      desired. (Leftover meat and bones can also be reserved for another use;
      add to fried rice or bibimbap or scoop out marrow and slather it over
      slices of grilled toast.) Skim fat from surface with a ladle and discard.
      Taste broth and season with more fish sauce or salt if needed. Set to low
      sauté and simmer gently while you cook the noodles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill a large pot one third of the way with water and bring to a rolling
      boil. Add noodles and cook, using chopsticks or a wooden spoon to stir,
      until just al dente, about 15 seconds. Drain noodles in a colander and
      rinse well under cold water to stop cooking. Drizzle a little oil over and
      toss to coat (this will keep them from sticking together).
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove brisket from water and thinly against the grain. Divide noodles
      among deep bowls. (Pro tip: Before adding noodles, swirl hot water inside
      bowls to warm up, then discard.) Top each bowl with a few slices of
      brisket, sliced beef eye of round, and any reserved meat and bones (if
      using) and top with sliced onion, scallions, and cilantro (if using);
      season with pepper. Ladle hot broth over raw beef to cook.
    </li>
    <li>
      Arrange Thai basil leaves, mint leaves, mung bean sprouts, chiles, and
      lime wedges on a platter for topping pho as desired and serve with
      Sriracha and hoisin sauce in small bowls for dipping.
    </li>
