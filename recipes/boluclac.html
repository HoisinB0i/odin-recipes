  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb Beef Rib Eye (or Sirloin) cut into ¾″ cubes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp garlic minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 juice of lime</li>
    <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>pinch of salt</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
    <li>1 tomato thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 medium sized onion thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 bell pepper sliced</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Prepare the beef marinade. Marinate the beef for at least 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Slice the onions thinly and use half of it for pickled onions. Just add 3
      tbsp of vinaigrette. Put in the fridge for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a wok and once the oil begins to smoke, add half
      of the beef and spread them out in one layer. Allow the beef to sear for
      at least 1 minute before “shaking” to sear the opposite side. Cook in
      batches, if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      While searing the beef, check the side of the beef not to get burned (the
      marinade has sugar added, so make sure the beef won’t easily get burned.)
      Continue to shake the beef for a minute or until the color turns a nice
      brown or medium rare. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clean the wok and add some oil until it gets smoky, add the remaining part
      of the beef. Do the same process until the beef turns brown.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the remaining half onions and the bell peppers and continue to shake
      until the vegetables (bell peppers + onions) are half cooked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer the beef into a bed of shredded cabbage or (whatever greens you
      like). Drizzle with 3 tbsp vinaigrette (this is optional). Top with
      pickled red onion (optional).
    </li>
  </ol>
